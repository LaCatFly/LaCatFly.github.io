A brief History
======
This is a website powered by Jekyll-based GitHub Pages. Since I first started to write a blog from 02/18/05, I have moved from MSN space to wordpress and from facebook to wechat. Finally (and probably not the end), a few events has led me to move again to Github. 


Sections Arrangement
======
Recent articles will be posted on the ['Post'](/year-archive/) tab above. A selection of previous publications (usually > 2 years) will be digitally stamped, that means those stamped will get a DOI number and I will not be able to change the document in any way. This protect the copy right and make them permenant. 


A Data-driven Space 
======
Github is a great place to share evidence supported ideas. With cloud data storage, flexible infrastructure and a large community, a number of complex tasks can be achieved effortlessly. A place certainly help me to tidy up some uncompleted works, something I would recommend to my friends.


The Open Book Project
======
With the flexible and IT infrastructure, I think it is probably the time to start the project. This is something I always want to do since campus life. Thinks the inspiration from DanQing Chen, who has correctly pointed out it is not a shame to not have accomplished
the target. It is rather difficult to make a start. Although I have never met him in personal, he actually gives me the encourage for being potentially under-achieved.
