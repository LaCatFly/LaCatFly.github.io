A brief note
======

This is a website powered by Jekyll-based GitHub Pages. Since I first started to write a blog from 02/18/05, I have moved from MSN space to wordpress and from facebook to wechat. Finally (and probably not the end), a few events has led me to move again to Github. 


A data-driven space 
======
Github is a great place to share evidence supported ideas. With cloud data storage, flexible infrastructure and a large community, a number of complex tasks can be achieved effortlessly. A place certainly help me to tidy up some uncompleted works, something I would recommend to my friends.
