A brief History
======
Since 02/18/05 when I first started to write a blog, it was an new service as part of MSN. Over the years, various new platforms such as Wordpress/Wechat has provided newer tool for creative contents. I like them and have used them, but my contents are scattered all over the internet. As publication numbers accumulate, it becomes uneconomic to operate in such way.


Sections Arrangement
======
All recent articles will be posted on the ['Post'](/year-archive/) tab above. A selection of previous publications (usually > 2 years) will be digitally stamped, that means those stamped will get a DOI number and I will not be able to change the document in any way. Such way the copy right is maintained and the publications are permenant. 


A Data-driven Space 
======
This is a website powered by Jekyll-based GitHub Pages. Github is a great place to share evidence supported ideas. With cloud data storage, flexible infrastructure and a large community. A number of complex tasks can be achieved effortlessly. A place certainly helps me to tidy up some uncompleted works, something I would recommend to any of my friends.


The Open Book Project
======
Now with the correct IT infrastructure & skills in place, I think it is probably the right time to start the journey. It is something I always dreamed to do. Thinks for the inspiration with regard to DanQing Chen, who has correctly pointed out it is not a shame to not have accomplished the target, but rather difficult to make a start. The encouragement for being potentially under-achieved, is actually the point.
