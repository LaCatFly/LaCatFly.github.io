A Brief History
======
Since 02/18/05 when I first wrote on blog, it was something quite new. Since than various new platforms, e.g. Wordpress/Wechat are now available for creative contents. I liked them and have used some of them, but contents produced are scattered all over the spaces. As more of them are produced, it becomes uneconomic to manage them all in such a way. I finally decided to manage my own space.


Sections Arrangement
======
All recent articles will be posted on the ['Post'](/year-archive/) tab above. A selection of previous publications (usually > 2 years) will be digitally stamped, that means those stamped get a DOI number and I will not be able to change the document in any way. The copy right is maintained and the publications are permenant. 


A Data-driven Space 
======
This is a website powered by Jekyll-based GitHub Pages. Github is a great place to share evidences based analytics & ideas. With new technology such as cloud storage facilitates, a flexible infrastructure and large community, to deploy a hub requires modest efforts . A number of complex tasks can be achieved relatively easily. It certainly helps to me to speed up my projects, something I would recommend to any of my friends.


The Open Book Project
======
With what I have got, I think it is probably the right time to start the journey, something I always wanted to do. Thinks for the inspiration from DanQing Chen, who has correctly pointed out it is not a shame to not have accomplished, but rather difficult to make a start. By knowing one of the outcomes would be a bad failure, but still committed to deliver, is actually the point.
