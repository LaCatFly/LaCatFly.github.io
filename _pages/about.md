A brief History
======
Since 02/18/05 when I first started to write a blog hosted by MSN, I had used various blogging platforms from wordpress to wechat. There are quite a few reasons led me to move Github mostly due to its open source nature, but it will probably not going to be the final place for me.  


Sections Arrangement
======
Recent articles will be posted on the ['Post'](/year-archive/) tab above. A selection of previous publications (usually > 2 years) will be digitally stamped, that means those stamped will get a DOI number and I will not be able to change the document in any way. This protect the copy right and make them permenant. 


A Data-driven Space 
======
This is a website powered by Jekyll-based GitHub Pages. Github is a great place to share evidence supported ideas. With cloud data storage, flexible infrastructure and a large community, a number of complex tasks can be achieved effortlessly. A place certainly help me to tidy up some uncompleted works, something I would recommend to my friends.


The Open Book Project
======
With the IT infrastructure, I think it is probably the time to start the project. This is something I always want to do since campus life. Thinks the inspiration from DanQing Chen, who has correctly pointed out it is not a shame to not have accomplished the target. It is rather difficult to make a start. Although I have never met him in personal, he actually gives me the encouragement for being potentially under-achieved.
